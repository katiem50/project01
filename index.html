  <p> Q1. What did you find challenging about this project?</p>
  <p> A1. The hardest thing about this project was page one. I had the hardest time getting any transition to work. I try just about everything and the only thing that worked was what is on the page. I was also unable to get the words to be centered under the pictures. I don’t know why the words whould not center. I tried a bunch of things and it just wouldn’t move. </p>
<p> Q2. What did you find interesting about this project?</p>
<p> A2. I found making the animation on page two to be very interesting and fun.</p>
<p> Q3. Did you use any resources to help you with this project? </p>
<p> A3. I used Google for just about everything on this project. Whenever something wouldn’t work I would look up to see if I did something wrong or to see if there was a different way to do things. </p>
<p> Q4. Did you try anything out and have to delete it because it just wasn't working?</p>
<p> A4. I try a lot of things that didn’t work on this project. Page one took me the longest and there were many things that didn’t work. At first my columns just would not line up. I originally wanted to add a fifth column but when I added it the website broke and I couldn’t figure out why because I had done the same thing that I had done with the other four columns, so I just decided to leave it out.   </p>
<p> Q5. How would you improve a portion of this project? </p>
<p> A5. The only thing that I would improve is the transforms and transitions. This is only because I struggled so much with this part. I just couldn’t get code to work, even when I copied and pasted from other websites and even now my transitions are still not doing exactly what I want it to do.  </p>
